# Zomato Lite
### Simple Web UI uses Zomato API

I am creating this project for a HACKATHON, which is a part of GUVI's Full Stack Developer Course Assesment. There were six problems, I prayed to god that I should not get this one project because I never ordered food online, I am not used to Zomato's app or interface, I have no idea about their API (well this is all nostalgic), but I got this specific project. Well let's see how far I can take this. I am hoping this to be a lot more fun than I am expecting it to be.

Well let me begin.

Roadmap:
-------

1. Get the Zomato API guide
2. Call some API's that looks necessary and get the JSOM messages
3. Examine the JSON, make sense of the response and get an idea of what the app needs and how can I use the response.
4. Getting a custom bootstrap theme that will suite the app
5. Building flows and screens
6. Implementing Screens
7. Filling screens with respective data
8. Bring out the expected flow.
9. May be some final touch (if required)
